### Student Name: Harry Kelly   Student ID: 20095354

Watchful Pi is an internet-connected, extensible, multi-device home security system that uses Raspberry Pi SBCs, cameras, and PIR sensors for home security monitoring. The first release will consist of a single Raspberry Pi with PIR sensor and camera that will detect movement, capture imagery, keep a log of detected security events, and allow users to remotely view a video stream.

The second release will add a hub device with an API that will facilitate discovery and management of multiple camera/sensor devices on the local network. The third release will add a web or mobile interface to the hub device, allowing the user to manage and access camera/sensor devices known to the hub.

Future releases may include cloud features such as computer vision API services and cloud storage of security logs.

## Tools, Technologies and Equipment

Hardware will include Raspberry Pi SBCs, digital cameras, and PIR sensors. Python will be the programming language used to implement most of the functionality. Depending on the final feature set, other languages that may be used for certain features include bash shell scripts for system administration tasks, HTML and CSS for front-end UI, and SQL for log storage and retrieval.

Cloud services that may be utilised include Blynk and Microsoft Azure. The primary development environment will be Visual Studio Code.
